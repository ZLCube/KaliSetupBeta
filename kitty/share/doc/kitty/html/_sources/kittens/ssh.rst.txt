Truly convenient SSH
=========================================

* Automatic :ref:`shell_integration` on remote hosts

* Easily :ref:`clone local shell/editor config <real_world_ssh_kitten_config>` on remote hosts

* Automatic :opt:`re-use of existing connections <kitten-ssh.share_connections>` to avoid connection setup latency

* Make kitty itself available in the remote host :opt:`on demand <kitten-ssh.remote_kitty>`

* Easily :opt:`change terminal colors <kitten-ssh.color_scheme>` when connecting to remote hosts

   Automatic shell integration, file transfer and reuse of connections

The ssh kitten allows you to login easily to remote hosts, and automatically
setup the environment there to be as comfortable as your local shell. You can
specify environment variables to set on the remote host and files to copy there,
making your remote experience just like your local shell. Additionally, it
automatically sets up :ref:`shell_integration` on the remote host and copies the
kitty terminfo database there.

The ssh kitten is a thin wrapper around the traditional `ssh <https://man.openbsd.org/ssh>`__
command line program and supports all the same options and arguments and configuration.
In interactive usage scenarios it is a drop in replacement for :program:`ssh`.
To try it out, simply run:

.. code-block:: sh

    kitty +kitten ssh some-hostname-to-connect-to

You should end up at a shell prompt on the remote host, with shell integration
enabled. If you like it you can add an alias to it in your shell's rc files:

.. code-block:: sh

    alias s="kitty +kitten ssh"

So now you can just type ``s hostname`` to connect.

If you define a mapping in :file:`kitty.conf` such as::

    map f1 new_window_with_cwd

Then, pressing :kbd:`F1` will open a new window automatically logged into the
same host using the ssh kitten, at the same directory.

The ssh kitten can be configured using the :file:`~/.config/kitty/ssh.conf` file
where you can specify environment variables to set on the remote host and files
to copy from the local to the remote host. Let's see a quick example:

.. code-block:: conf

   # Copy the files and directories needed to setup some common tools
   copy .zshrc .vimrc .vim
   # Setup some environment variables
   env SOME_VAR=x
   # COPIED_VAR will have the same value on the remote host as it does locally
   env COPIED_VAR=_kitty_copy_env_var_

   # Create some per hostname settings
   hostname someserver-*
   copy env-files
   env SOMETHING=else

   hostname someuser@somehost
   copy --dest=foo/bar some-file
   copy --glob some/files.*


See below for full details on the syntax and options of :file:`ssh.conf`.
Additionally, you can pass config options on the command line:

.. code-block:: sh

   kitty +kitten ssh --kitten interpreter=python servername

The :code:`--kitten` argument can be specified multiple times, with directives
from :file:`ssh.conf`. These are merged with :file:`ssh.conf` as if they were
appended to the end of that file. They apply only to the host being SSHed to by
this invocation, so any :opt:`hostname <kitten-ssh.hostname>` directives are
ignored.

.. warning::

   Due to limitations in the design of SSH, any typing you do before the
   shell prompt appears may be lost. So ideally don't start typing till you see
   the shell prompt. ðŸ˜‡


.. _real_world_ssh_kitten_config:

A real world example
----------------------

Suppose you often SSH into a production server, and you would like to setup
your shell and editor there using your custom settings. However, other people
could SSH in as well and you don't want to clobber their settings. Here is how
this could be achieved using the ssh kitten with :program:`zsh` and
:program:`vim` as the shell and editor, respectively:

.. code-block:: conf

   # Have these settings apply to servers in my organization
   hostname myserver-*

   # Setup zsh to read its files from my-conf/zsh
   env ZDOTDIR $HOME/my-conf/zsh
   copy --dest my-conf/zsh/.zshrc .zshrc
   copy --dest my-conf/zsh/.zshenv .zshenv
   # If you use other zsh init files add them in a similar manner

   # Setup vim to read its config from my-conf/vim
   env VIMINIT $HOME/my-conf/vim/vimrc
   env VIMRUNTIME $HOME/my-conf/vim
   copy --dest my-conf/vim .vim
   copy --dest my-conf/vim/vimrc .vimrc


How it works
----------------

The ssh kitten works by having SSH transmit and execute a POSIX sh (or
:opt:`optionally <kitten-ssh.interpreter>` Python) bootstrap script on the
remote host using an :opt:`interpreter <kitten-ssh.interpreter>`. This script
reads setup data over the TTY device, which kitty sends as a Base64 encoded
compressed tarball. The script extracts it and places the :opt:`files <kitten-ssh.copy>`
and sets the :opt:`environment variables <kitten-ssh.env>` before finally
launching the :opt:`login shell <kitten-ssh.login_shell>` with :opt:`shell
integration <kitten-ssh.shell_integration>` enabled. The data is requested by
the kitten over the TTY with a random one time password. kitty reads the request
and if the password matches a password pre-stored in shared memory on the
localhost by the kitten, the transmission is allowed. If your local
`OpenSSH <https://www.openssh.com/>`__ version is >= 8.4 then the data is
transmitted instantly without any roundtrip delay.

.. note::

   When connecting to BSD hosts, it is possible the bootstrap script will fail
   or run slowly, because the default shells are crippled in various ways.
   Your best bet is to install Python on the remote, make sure the login shell
   is something POSIX sh compliant, and use :code:`python` as the
   :opt:`interpreter <kitten-ssh.interpreter>` in :file:`ssh.conf`.


.. note::

   This may or may not work when using terminal multiplexers, depending on
   whether they passthrough the escape codes and if the values of the
   environment variables :envvar:`KITTY_PID` and :envvar:`KITTY_WINDOW_ID` are
   correct in the current session (they can be wrong when connecting to a tmux
   session running in a different window) and the ssh kitten is run in the
   currently active multiplexer window.
